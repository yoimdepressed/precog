After a long wait the jury filed in and took\ntheir places; shortly afterward, Potter, pale and haggard, timid and\nhopeless, was brought in, with chains upon him, and seated where all\nthe curious eyes could stare at him; no less conspicuous was Injun Joe,\nstolid as ever. There was another pause, and then the judge arrived and\nthe sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court. The usual whisperings\namong the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed. These\ndetails and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation\nthat was as impressive as it was fascinating.", "class": "Human", "author": "Mark Twain", "book": "Tom Sawyer", "word_count": 154}

Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright. I used to\nbe quite angry with Selina; but really I begin now to comprehend that a\nmarried woman has many things to call her attention.
